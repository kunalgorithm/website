---

This tutorial covers how to build a fullstack application that allows users to sign up or login, then post tweets to a global feed. You can find the code for the completed app [here](https://github.com/kunalgorithm/fullstack-twitter).

A demo of what we'll be building is currently deployed at [fullstack-twitter.onrender.com](https://fullstack-twitter.onrender.com)

[![Finished Screenshot](/images/building-a-fullstack-twitter-clone/authed-screenshot.png)](https://fullstack-twitter.onrender.com)

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have node and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

## Getting Started

First, create a new npm project

```shell
mkdir fullstack-twitter-clone
cd fullstack-twitter-clone
npm init -y
```

Now, add dependencies for [next.js](https://nextjs.org) and react, as well as some typed development dependencies

```bash
yarn add next react react-dom
yarn add --dev typescript @types/react @types/node
```

Now, we create the designated `pages` directory that next.js uses for file-based routing.

```bash
mkdir pages
```

Every file within the `pages` directory is compiled into it's own route, so `index.tsx` can be visited at `/`, `about.tsx` at `/about`, and so on.

Lets add the following component to our first page, `index.tsx`.

```jsx:pages/index.tsx
export default () => <div> hello, world! </div>;
```

Now, run the Nextjs development server

```bash
npx next
```

and visit http://localhost:3000 to see our first component in action. We should have a barebones unstyled webpage with "hello, world!" in the top left.

### The backend

Now that our react code has the client up and running, let's use Next.js's API routes to write a backend handler in the designated `api` directory within `pages`

```bash
mkdir pages/api
```

Create a file, `feed.ts` within the `api` directory and create a simple function that returns an array.

```ts:pages/api/feed.ts
export default (req, res) => res.json({ feed: [] });
```

Head to http://localhost:3000/api/feed and you should see some json within your browser.

```json
{
  "feed": []
}
```

Let's make our feed more interesting by adding some fake tweets to `feed.ts`

```ts:pages/api/feed.ts
export default (req, res) => {
  const feed = [
    {
      text:
        'Wow not having to configure and transpile typescript is one of the best parts of next.js',
      author: { username: 'john' }
    },
    {
      text:
        "I'm a firm believer that dark mode should be a universal default on the web",
      author: { username: 'jill' }
    }
  ];
  res.json(feed);
};
```

> Bonus: you can take a sneak peek at the feed endpoint of the production app, which our endpoint will eventually build up to, at [fullstack-twitter.onrender.com/api/feed](https://fullstack-twitter.onrender.com/api/feed)

Visit your browser again you should see the fake tweets being rendered as raw json.

![Feed JSON preview](/images/building-a-fullstack-twitter-clone/feed-json.png)

> Note: I have a browser extension, [JSON formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en), installed that prettifies raw JSON, like in the screenshot above.

### Put the two together

The real power with this approach is that we can write frontend and backend code in the same place, in the same language, and split the logic accordingly. All of the source code goes into the `pages` directory, and the backend code is limited to the `api` directory. Each seperate file, whether a frontend page or a backend route, is compiled into it's own endpoint, and the two work together to power a fullstack application.

To pull them together, we query the new `api/feed` endpoint from the `pages/index.tsx` page, and show our list of tweets to the user. We're going to user a small library called [SWR](https://swr.now.sh) for our data fetching, which handles caching, locally changing data during POST requests, and revalidation. The power of SWR and it's ability to make handling cached data on the frontend will soon become obvious.

Also, we want our app to be beautiful on more than just the inside, so let's use [Ant Design](https://ant.design) to boostrap our interface's styles.

First, we install both libraries

```bash
yarn add swr antd
```

Create a top-level `components` directory, and a `util` directory within that. Inside `util`, create `fetcher.tsx` and `hooks.tsx`.

Within `fetcher.tsx` we have

```tsx:components/util/fetcher.tsx
export const fetcher = (url, data = undefined) =>
  fetch(window.location.origin + url, {
    method: data ? 'POST' : 'GET',
    credentials: 'include',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
  }).then((r) => r.json());
```

This basically abstracts away the complexity of POST and GET requests when using SWR, so the requests within the components themselves won't clutter up our react code.

In `hooks.tsx` we add

```tsx:components/util/hooks.tsx
import useSWR from 'swr';
import { fetcher } from './fetcher';

export function useFeed() {
  const { data: feed } = useSWR('/api/feed', fetcher);
  return { feed };
}
```

Finally, let's pull this all together in `components/Feed.tsx`, rendering each Tweet in Ant Design's `Card` component

```tsx:components/Feed.tsx
import { Card } from 'antd';
import { useFeed } from './util/hooks';

export const Feed = () => {
  const { feed } = useFeed();
  return feed ? (
    <>
      {feed.map(({ id, text, author }, i) => (
        <Card key={i}>
          <h4>{text}</h4>
          <span>{author.username}</span>
        </Card>
      ))}
    </>
  ) : null;
};
```

which will give us the same contents as the value of the json endpoint, demonstrating that the data is being retrieved correctly. Finally, we can render the feed in `pages/index.tsx`
ah

```tsx:pages/index.tsx
import { Col, Row } from 'antd';
import { Feed } from '../components/Feed';

export default () => (
  <Row>
    <Col md={{ span: 10, offset: 8 }}>
      <Feed />
    </Col>
  </Row>
);
```

For one last detail, we need to import Ant Design's CSS stylesheet into our app, so that it's automatically included in all our pages. We do this with a special file, `_app.js` in the `pages` directory, which next.js uses to wrap all of the other pages.

```js:pages/_app.js
import 'antd/dist/antd.css';

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}
```

> Note: you'll have to restart your development server for changes to `_app.js` to take effect.

Now visit http://localhost:3000 and we'll see the naked data from our backend being rendered

![Card Tweets with Ant Design preview](/images/building-a-fullstack-twitter-clone/card-tweets.png)

### Creating new tweets

Our twitter app won't work if all users can do is _read_ tweets, so we need to give them a way to create them too. Let's add a form component that users can useto add new tweets. Inside `components` create `CreateTweetForm.tsx`.

> Notice the naming conventions, which are entirely for the sake of organization and can be changed to your liking:
>
> - Components are capitalized TSX files (`Feed.tsx`)
> - Pages are lowercased TSX files (`index.tsx`)
> - API routes are lowercased TS files (`feed.ts`)

In `CreateTweetForm.tsx` we call the same `useFeed()` hook as in `Feed.tsx`, and we additionally make use of the `mutate` export from swr. This allows us to change the local state of our feed to reflect the change, even before it's registered by the server, so the user can see their new tweet right away.

```tsx:components/CreateTweetForm.tsx
import { Button, message, Row, Col, Input } from 'antd';
import { mutate } from 'swr';
import { fetcher } from './util/fetcher';
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useFeed } from './util/hooks';

export const CreateTweetForm = () => {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const { feed } = useFeed();

  return (
    <form
      style={{ padding: '2rem' }}
      onSubmit={async (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();

        // we include "false" here to ask SWR not to revalidate the cache with
        // the feed returned from the server. we'll remove this after the next section
        mutate(
          '/api/feed',
          [{ text: input, author: { username: 'Marshall Mathers' } }, ...feed],
          false
        );

        setInput('');
      }}
    >
      <Row>
        <Col>
          <Input value={input} onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)} />
        </Col>

        <Col>
          <Button htmlType="submit">Tweet</Button>
        </Col>
      </Row>
    </form>
  );
};
```

Import `CreateTweetForm` into the index page and render it directly above the `Feed` component. Be sure to test this on localhost to ensure you can spam your feed with every thought with which you desire.

The only problem, you may have noticed, is that tweets don't stick around if you refresh your browser. This is because we are currently adding new tweets to SWR's local cache, but is not being sent to the backend or stored anywhere that persist independently of browser sessions and devices.

Essentially, we need a way for:

1. Tweets to stick around if you refresh the browser or go take a nap.
2. Your friends to be able to see your tweets on their computers.

## Enter: sqlite + Prisma

Now that we've got our app working nicely on single-player instances, we need to make it immune to the effects of time and refreshes by storing all of our users' data somewhere persistent. We do this by bringing in our old friend, **the database**. With it, we'll use [Prisma](https://prisma.io) to handle the datamodel, access the data, and give us type safety throughout the application.

We start by adding prisma to our project

```bash
yarn add prisma
```

Then initialize the prisma project with

```bash
npx prisma init
```

You'll notice that a `prisma` directory was created, and within it a `schema.prisma` file and a `.env`. You can ignore the latter for now, since we'll be using sqlite to get started and prototype faster, and switching to postgres later as we prepare for deployment.

To configure prisma to use sqlite and to point the prisma client to a local sqlite file on your machine, update the datasource and client attributes within `schema.prisma`

```diff
datasource sqlite {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:./dev.db"
}

generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = ["native"]
}
```

Now, we can add a model for new tweets

```diff:prisma/schema.prisma
model Tweet {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @default(now())
  text     String
}
```

When creating a tweet, the `id` will be automatically generated and assigned an integer, starting from 1 and incrementing from there, and the `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields will automatically be filled with timestamps at the moment of creation. So, all we need to do is pass a valid string into the `text` field, and we'll have created our first `Tweet` entry.

So, we can create a tweet with

```ts
const tweet = await prisma.tweet.create({ data: { text: 'Hello, Twitter!' } });
```

Now let's put this to use to allow users to create tweets.

### Generate the prisma client

Before we begin, let's add some scripts to `package.json` to make it easier for us to call `prisma migrate` commands, as well a few more to facilitate the build process for when we deploy our app to production.

```json
"scripts": {
    "migrate": "prisma migrate dev --preview-feature",
    "generate":"prisma generate",
    "dev": "next",
    "start": "next start",
    "build": "next build"
},
```

Now that we're set up, we can create the sqlite database file, run the migration to create the new table, and then generate the prisma client to create and access tweets.

First, we create the sqlite file and run the migration.

```bash
yarn migrate
```

Now, we can generate the prisma client, which lives in the `node_modules` directory and is generated on the fly (usually in a postintall hook) to give us up-to-date typesafe access to our data.

Create the client by running

```bash
yarn generate
```

Which peeks into our schema file for the models defined, generates the client in `node_modules/@prisma/client` and concludes with some output dictating exactly how we can use it in our code.

### Actually creating tweets

Within the `api` directory, create another directory `tweet`, and within that `create.ts`. This will be another backend function that takes some `text` and gives us back a tweet object.

```ts:pages/api/tweet/create.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export default async (req, res) => {
  const { text } = req.body;
  const tweet = await prisma.tweet.create({ data: { text } });
  res.json(tweet);
};
```

Notice that we are assuming the `text` to be attached to the body of the request.

Now, lets try calling this function from our frontend. After the call to `mutate` in our index page, add

```ts:components/CreateTweetForm.tsx
fetcher('/api/tweet/create', {
  text: input
});
```

Remember to `import { fetcher } from "./util/fetcher"` at the top of the file.

Now, try creating another tweet in the browser and head to the **Network** tab of the console to see the results. You should see a request titled **create**, after the suffix of the endpoint, and click it to view the resposne. If the response worked, you'll see a response JSON object with an `id`, `createdAt`, and `text` fields.

### Feed 2.0

Now that we can create tweets in our database, let's change our feed API function to retrieve tweets from the database instead of giving us back hardcoded data. Open `pages/api/feed.ts` and change the contents to

```ts:pages/api/feed.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export default async (req, res) => {
  const tweets = await prisma.tweet.findMany({
    orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' }
  });
  res.json(tweets);
};
```

and you'll now be able to create tweets, refresh the page, and see them live on.

## Authentication

Our app can't compete with twitter if you can't log in and no one knows who's posts are whose, can it? Let's fix this by giving users a way to log in.

We're going to allow users to sign up, encrypt their passwords with [bcrypt](http://bcryptjs.com) then authorize their device by attaching a server-side [HttpOnly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) cookie to their requests.

Basically, we're gonna build a safe and secure way to allow users to sign in with passwords while making sure they or we don't get hacked.

First, we introduce the `User` model in `schema.prisma`

```diff:prisma/schema.prisma
model User {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  username    String @unique
  password    String
  tweets      Tweet[]
}
```

You'll notice that every `user` has a `tweets` field that corresponds to an array of Tweets. This allows us to access a users tweets as simply as with `user.tweets`. Also, let's add the other side of the relationship by adding `authorId` and `author` fields to `Tweet`.

```diff:prisma/schema.prisma
model Tweet {
  id         Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt  DateTime @default(now())
  text       String
+  authorId   Int
+  author     User @relation(fields: [authorId], references:[id])
}

```

Now, we can save and run our database migrations to apply our changes. Let's use the scripts we added to `package.json` earlier.

```bash
yarn migrate
yarn generate
```

Then, we add our new dependencies

```bash
yarn add bcrypt jsonwebtoken cookie
```

We're going to handle authentication and reflect this to the user by rendering a `Profile` component on the page, which will show the user's details if they're logged in, and a `SignupForm` otherwise.

Let's start by creating `Profile.tsx`

```tsx:components/Profile.tsx
import { Row, Col, Button, message } from 'antd';
import { SignupForm } from './SignupForm';
import { useMe } from './util/hooks';
import { useState } from 'react';

export const Profile = () => {
  const { me } = useMe();
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  if (!me) return null;

  return (
    <Row style={{ padding: '1.5rem' }}>
      {!me.username ? (
        <SignupForm />
      ) : (
        <Col>
          Logged in as: <strong>{me.username}</strong>
          {/* TODO: we'll add a logout button here */}
        </Col>
      )}
    </Row>
  );
};
```

Now, render `<Profile />` in `pages/index.tsx` so we can view our new component.

You'll notice we're using a new hook, `useMe`. As you can guess, this will return the currently authenticated user. Let's go ahead and add this hook to our hooks utility.

```tsx:components/util/hooks.tsx
import { User } from '@prisma/client';

// useFeed function

export function useMe() {
  const { data: me }: { data?: User } = useSWR('/api/me', fetcher);
  return { me };
}
```

Notice that we're importing the `User` interface from prisma and applying it to the return type of the hook. This will give us typesafety through the frontend when working with our data, and is one of the most powerful advantages of using Prisma with React Hooks.

Also, our use of SWR will automatically deduplicate uses of `useMe` since they have the same key, `/api/me`. This means we can call `useMe` in several different components, and our app will only make a single request to the backend.

We'll implement the `/api/me` endpoint right after we've built the signup form and endpoints.

### The `SignupForm`

Then we can create the form itself

```tsx:components/SignupForm.tsx
import { Row, Col, Button, message, Input } from 'antd';
import { useState } from 'react';
import { mutate } from 'swr';
import { fetcher } from './util/fetcher';
export const SignupForm = ({}) => {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [login, setLogin] = useState(false);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  return (
    <Row>
      <Col>
        <h3>Sign up</h3>
        <form
          onSubmit={async (e) => {
            e.preventDefault();
            if (username.length === 0 || password.length === 0) {
              message.error(
                "Uh oh: you can't have a blank username or password."
              );
            }
            setLoading(true);
            const { data, error } = await fetcher(
              `/api/${login ? 'login' : 'signup'}`,
              {
                username,
                password
              }
            );
            if (error) {
              message.error(error);
              setLoading(false);
              return;
            }
            await mutate('/api/me');
          }}
        >
          <div>
            <Input
              value={username}
              onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)}
              type="name"
              placeholder="Username"
            />

            <Input
              value={password}
              onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
              type="password"
              placeholder="Password"
            />
          </div>
          <div>
            <Button htmlType="submit" loading={loading}>
              {login ? 'Login' : 'Sign up'}
            </Button>
          </div>
          <div>
            <a onClick={() => setLogin(!login)}>
              {login ? 'New? Sign Up' : 'Already a user? Log In'}
            </a>
          </div>
        </form>
      </Col>
    </Row>
  );
};
```

Notice that our Signup form also serves as a login form, and can switch between the two. Also, it will post to the endpoint `/api/signup` if the user is signing up, and to `/api/login` otherwise. As you may have guessed, now we'll have to create these two API files to handle the signing up and logging in process themselves.

Let's start with `signup` which

1. Salts and hashes the `password` with Bcrypt
2. Creates a User in the database with prisma
3. Signs a `jsonwebtoken` with the `id` and `username` of the user and the `JWT_SECRET` from the environment.
4. Sets an [httpOnly cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)

```ts:pages/api/signup.ts
import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
import cookie from 'cookie';
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export default async (req, res) => {
  const salt = bcrypt.genSaltSync();
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  let user;
  try {
    user = await prisma.user.create({
      data: {
        username,
        password: bcrypt.hashSync(password, salt)
      }
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.json({ error: 'A user with that username already exists 😮' });
    return;
  }
  const token = jwt.sign(
    { username: user.username, id: user.id, time: new Date() },
    process.env.JWT_SECRET,
    {
      expiresIn: '6h'
    }
  );

  res.setHeader(
    'Set-Cookie',
    cookie.serialize('token', token, {
      httpOnly: true,
      maxAge: 6 * 60 * 60,
      path: '/',
      sameSite: 'lax',
      secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
    })
  );
  res.json(user);
  return;
};
```

Now, we can implement a similarly-structured `login` route.

```ts:pages/api/login.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
const prisma = new PrismaClient();
import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
import cookie from 'cookie';

export default async (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;

  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: { username }
  });

  if (user && bcrypt.compareSync(password, user.password)) {
    const token = jwt.sign(
      { username: user.username, id: user.id, time: new Date() },
      process.env.JWT_SECRET,
      {
        expiresIn: '6h'
      }
    );

    res.setHeader(
      'Set-Cookie',
      cookie.serialize('token', token, {
        httpOnly: true,
        maxAge: 6 * 60 * 60,
        path: '/',
        sameSite: 'lax',
        secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
      })
    );

    res.json(user);
  } else {
    res.json({ error: 'Incorrect username or password 🙁' });
    return;
  }
};
```

Before we forget, create a `.env` file in the top-level directory and add

```
JWT_SECRET=appsecret123
```

Replace `appsecret123` with some less-guessable combination of characters, and restart your development server.

### The `Me` Endpoint

Finally, we can build `/api/me`

```ts:pages/api/me.ts
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export default async (req, res) => {
  const { token } = req.cookies;

  if (token) {
    const { id, username } = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    const me = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id } });
    res.json(me);
  } else {
    res.json({});
  }
};
```

Also, we can return the author of each tweet in the `feed`, so that we can render their usernames

```ts:pages/api/feed.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export default async (req, res) => {
  const tweets = await prisma.tweet.findMany({
    orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
    include: { author: { select: { username: true, id: true } } }
  });
  res.json(tweets);
};
```

If you're using VSCode and hover over the `tweets` variable, typescript will show us that the feed is now of type

```ts
const tweets: (Tweet & {
  user: {
    author: {
      username: string;
      id: number;
    };
  };
})[];
```

So we can update our `useFeed` hook to return the same type, the same as we did for `useMe` earlier.

```tsx:components/util/hooks.tsx
import { Tweet, User } from '@prisma/client';
import useSWR from 'swr';
import { fetcher } from './fetcher';

export function useFeed() {
  const { data: feed }: { data?: (Tweet & { author: User })[] } = useSWR(
    '/api/feed',
    fetcher
  );
  return { feed };
}
export function useMe() {
  const { data: me }: { data?: User } = useSWR('/api/me', fetcher);
  return { me };
}
```

### Attaching tweets to authors

One last thing: we need to attach the logged in user to each tweet that's created as it's author. We do this by using the `token` the same way we do in `/api/me`, and then using the prisma client's `connect` property.

```ts:pages/api/tweet/create.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
export default async (req, res) => {
  const prisma = new PrismaClient();

  const { token } = req.cookies;

  if (token) {
    // Get authenticated user
    const { _id, username } = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    const { text } = req.body;

    const tweet = await prisma.tweet.create({
      data: { text, author: { connect: { username } } }
    });
    res.json(tweet);
  } else {
    res.json({ error: 'You must be logged in to tweet.' });
  }
};
```

Now, test the app on localhost to make sure you can sign up and create new tweets.

## Final Touches

It would be nice if users could delete their tweets after they've posted them, as well as log themselves out. Let's create some button components to facilitate this.

To know if a user can delete a tweet, we need to check if the user is the tweet's author. Then we can make a call to a new API endpoint for deleting a tweet, and then locally mutate the cache to remove the tweet from the feed.

Create a new component `DeleteButton.tsx` in components.

```tsx:components/DeleteTweetButton
import { Button } from 'antd';
import { mutate } from 'swr';
import { fetcher } from './util/fetcher';

export const DeleteButton = ({ id, feed }) => (
  <Button
    style={{ float: 'right' }}
    danger
    type="dashed"
    onClick={async () => {
      await fetcher('/api/tweet/delete', { id });
      await mutate(
        '/api/feed',
        feed.filter((t) => t.id !== id)
      );
    }}
  >
    x
  </Button>
);
```

and import and render it in the feed component.

```diff:components/Feed.tsx
+ import { DeleteButton } from "./DeleteButton";
...

 <Card key={i}>
+  {me && author.id === me.id && (
+    <DeleteButton id={id} feed={feed} />
+  )}
  <h4>{text}</h4>
  <span>{author.username}</span>
 </Card>

```

Now, let's create the backend half of the equation. Create a new API route for `/api/tweet/delete` that takes the `id` from the body of the request, then passes it to prisma's `delete` method, and returns the (now empty) tweet.

```ts:pages/api/tweet/delete

import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export default async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.body;

  const tweet = await prisma.tweet.delete({
    where: { id }
  });

  res.json(tweet);
  return;
};
```

Test to make sure you can now delete your own (and only your own) tweets.

Great! Now let's follow the very same process to facillitate logging out.

Create a `LogoutButton.tsx`

```tsx:components/LogoutButton.tsx
import { Button, message } from 'antd';
import { mutate } from 'swr';
import { fetcher } from './util/fetcher';
import { useState } from 'react';
export const LogoutButton = () => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  return (
    <Button
      loading={loading}
      onClick={async () => {
        setLoading(true);
        const { data, error } = await fetcher('/api/logout');
        if (error) {
          message.error(error);
          setLoading(false);
          return;
        }
        await mutate('/api/me');
      }}
    >
      Log Out
    </Button>
  );
};
```

Then import and render it in Profile

```diff:components/Profile.tsx
+ import { LogoutButton } from "./LogoutButton";
...

 <Col>
    Logged in as: <strong>{me.username}</strong>
    <br />
+   <LogoutButton  />

 </Col>

```

For our final step, we create the logout API route

```ts:pages/api/logout.ts
import { serialize } from 'cookie';

export default (req, res) => {
  const cookie = serialize('token', '', {
    maxAge: -1,
    path: '/'
  });

  res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', cookie);
  res.json({ loggedOut: true });
};
```

Try and logout, and behold that our app is complete.
