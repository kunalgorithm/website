Something I haven't been particularly vocal about is how transformative of an impact meditation has had on my life over the last few years. It's as simple of a practice as can be (you literally just sit there) but I'm convinced we don't even have the words to describe the relief brought about by "watching yourself think."
I always wondered if there was a way I could share the extraordinary benefits I've gained from meditation and hold myself accountable to others as a way of keeping my practice consistent.

Thanks why I built [MindStreaks](https://mindstreaks.com) with [Patricia Mou](https://twitter.com/_patriciamou). Today, we're finally ready to share what we've built. We're live on product hunt and would be so grateful if you could take a moment to upvote or comment on our post 🙏
