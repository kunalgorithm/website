Today, I found an addon, [Chinese Support Redux](https://github.com/luoliyan/chinese-support-redux), that makes learning chinese vocabular quite a bit more effective when using [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/about) by automatically translating chinese characters and attaching the right pronunciation from Google Translate.

The trouble is that it's found itself without a maintainer recently and is consequently quite tricky to set up. Here's how I did it.

### Steps

1. Delete the plugin from Anki add-ons
2. Download and unzip [this](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS) repo.
3. Drag the `chinese` directory from folder into the your Anki `addons21` folder (for me, this is `/Users/kunal/Library/Application Support/Anki2/addons21`)
4. Rename it to `1128979221`, the original addon code.
5. Restart Anki and follow the original [usage](https://github.com/luoliyan/chinese-support-redux#usage) instructions to create and auto-populate cards.

### Specifications

- macOS Big Sur 11.1
- Anki Version 2.1.41
