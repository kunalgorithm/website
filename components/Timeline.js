        Spent 6 months after graduation travelling solo throughout Singapore,
        Thailand, Bali, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Taiwan.

      <Step title="Started at TrustedFor">
        A few months into my travels I started to realize that If I wanted to
        bring my skills to the next level, I needed to work with other people. I
        got introduced to <a href="https://trustedfor.com">TrustedFor</a> and
        got started (remotely, while in Vietnam) as their first engineering
        hire. The job was as challenging as it was rewarding, and I eventually
        took ownership of the client-side code as I grew more comfortable with
        the stack.
