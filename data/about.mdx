Hey, Iâ€™m Kunal. I'm interested in improving the limits of human
performance. I'm a software engineer by training and biology
tinkerer by curiosity.

I'm currently living in Brooklyn New York, with my girlfriend
Patricia and our dog, [Arlo](https://www.instagram.com/arlobrooklynfrenchie/").

I work at [Levels](https://levelshealth.com), where I'm focused on
building tools to help our members understand and improve their
metabolic health. Previously, I led engineering as part of the founding team at [On
Deck](https://beondeck.com), where I built Via, a referral-based
hiring platform and Cosign, a peer-to-peer credentialing network.

Before that, I founded [Rice Blockchain](https://blockchain.rice.edu/) and competed in D1 track
and field at Rice University, where I studied computer science.

Most recently, I've been spending my free time skiing, listening to EDM,
playing Beat Saber on [Oculus](https://oculus.com), and learning
about things that interest me. I created this site primarily for the
purpose of documenting and sharing my learnings.
