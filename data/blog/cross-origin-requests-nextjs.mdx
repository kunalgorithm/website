Using `httpOnly` cookies adds a level of security to your application by authenticating clients without making the cookie or JWT readable via javascript on the client itself. These are particularly useful to authenticate resources in [Next.js API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).

Here's how to set up `fetch` in the browser to work with Next's API [middlewares](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/api-middlewares).

Fetch exposes an option to [include credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch#sending_a_request_with_credentials_included) made to a resource, which attach server-side `httpOnly` cookies attached to the domain.

We set the request up to `include` credentials:

```js
fetch("https://example.com/api/secure_resource", {
    method: 'GET',
    credentials:'include',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({data})
}
```

Now, we need to receive a specific set of headers from the server to pass the cors requirements. The documentation warns us

<ErrorMessage>
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin is prohibited from using a wildcard for requests
  with credentials: 'include'. In such cases, the exact origin must be provided;
  even if you are using a CORS unblocker extension, the requests will still
  fail.
</ErrorMessage>

Consequently we configure CORS at the beginning of our API routes to preconfigure the correct headers.

First, we set up middlewares according to the documentation

```ts:init-middleware.ts
function initMiddleware(middleware) {
  return (req, res) =>
    new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      middleware(req, res, (result) => {
        if (result instanceof Error) {
          return reject(result);
        }
        return resolve(result);
      });
    });
}
```

Then create an `initCors` method

```ts:init-middleware.ts highlight=3
// top of the file
import Cors from "cors";

// Initialize the cors middleware
export const initCors = initMiddleware(
  // You can read more about the available options here: https://github.com/expressjs/cors#configuration-options
  Cors({
    methods: ["GET", "HEAD", "PUT", "PATCH", "POST", "DELETE"],
    origin: ["http://other-example.com", "http://localhost:3001"],
    credentials: true,
  })
);
```

Notice that we cannot set `origin` to `*` to allow requests from _any_ domain when the request has `credentials` set to `include`. Moreover, we'll need to set `credentials` to `true` on the server response in order to set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to `true`, which is necessary for the preflight request from the browser to pass and allow the original request to be made.

### Dynamic Origins

If you require a dynamic origin alongside `credentials: include`, you can combine the two methods above and reflect the requests' `origin` property from the preflight request's headers

```ts
export function runMiddleware(req, res) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    Cors({
      methods: ['GET', 'HEAD', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'POST', 'DELETE'],
      origin: req.headers.origin,
      credentials: true
    })(req, res, (result) => {
      if (result instanceof Error) {
        return reject(result);
      }

      return resolve(result);
    });
  });
}
```
